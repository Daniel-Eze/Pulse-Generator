THIS PROJECT WAS IMPLEMENTED ON TWO LEVELS, THEY ARE AS FOLLOWS:

Level 1 of this project involved the capability to make an LED blink after user input of values for T0 and T1, and subsequent storage in memory. The project's hierarchical structure necessitated the completion of each previous level before advancing to the next. Level 1 required entering T0 and T1, storing parameters, and displaying them on the LCD. The system was expected to operate robustly.
Level 2 added the ability to blink two LEDs at different frequencies simultaneously. In this level, I was able to successfully blink two LEDs at the same with two different frequencies. I achieved this by internally modifying my code to invert the T0 and T1 inputs and pass it as an output to a different port, thereby making the second LED blink at a different frequency than the first.
